Chatbot using Natural Language Processing

Jackson is a chatbot using natural language processing. Jackson is not a commercial chatbot.
It is mostly for educational purposes.

Jackson is separated into 3 parts.

1) Classify user input

2) Building a query

3) Searching and extracting information based on the query

__Currently Jackson is around 10% implemented.__ 

## 1. Input(Question) Classification ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/30) 

I am currently using a basic classification - Naive Bayes with no feature engineering. 
The classifier works with 30% accuracy. It is going to be improved in the future.

## 2. Building query ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)

The query will most likely be based on some key words extracted through nlp from the question.

## 3. Information retrieval ![Progress](http://progressed.io/bar/0)

The information will initially come from Wikipedia and later from some databases also.

## Possible features that may(or may not) eventually be implemented
